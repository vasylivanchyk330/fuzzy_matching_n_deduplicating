This project's main aims are to gain hands-on experience in fuzzy matching and to build a mathimatical intuition. 

2 approaches are used:
- using fuzzymatcher()
- using Python Record Linkage Toolkit

In the end, I used Python Record Linkage Toolkit to deduplicate matched data.

Content:
1. csv_files folder
2. results folder
3. scrnshts_for_math_algs where some screenshots for Levenshtein_Distance_Algorithm.ipynb file are located
4. code_fuzzy_matching_n_deduplicating.ipynb where the main chunk of code are located
5. Levenshtein_Distance_Algorithm.ipynb devoted to build a mathimatical intuition.

Datasets:
- hospital_reimbursement 
- hospital_account_info
- hospital_account_dupes
All 3 were taken from https://pbpython.com/record-linking.html
